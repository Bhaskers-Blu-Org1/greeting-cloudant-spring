# Greetings with Spring and Cloudant

The Cloudant Java SDK has new support for Spring Framework and Spring Boot.

This repository contains a few projects to walk you through what this new support provides when working with Spring and Cloudant.

Projects: 

* [greeting-springboot-auto](greeting-springboot-auto/): Using the new `com.cloudant:cloudant-spring-boot-starter` library to connect to a Cloudant database
* [greeting-spring-framework](greeting-spring-framework/): Using the new `@EnableCloudant` annotation from the `com.cloudant:cloudant-spring-framework` library to connect to a Cloudant database
* [greeting-springboot](greeting-springboot/): Connecting to Cloudant database only using the Cloudant Java library `com.cloudant:cloudant-client`
